# DS-Assignment-6

This assignment analyzes a diamond dataset to explore factors influencing diamond prices, such as carat, cut quality, and depth. It includes visualizations like bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms to examine relationships between variables. Statistical tests, including Pearson correlation and t-tests, are used to assess the significance of factors like carat size and cut quality on price. A log transformation is applied to the price data to address skewness, improving the results of statistical analyses. Key insights include a strong correlation between carat size and price, a prevalence of "Ideal" and "Premium" cuts, and a skewed price distribution, which is normalized through the log transformation. This analysis provides valuable insights into the diamond market and offers a foundation for further exploration.
